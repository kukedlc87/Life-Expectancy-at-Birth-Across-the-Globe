# Life-Expectancy-at-Birth-Across-the-Globe

About Dataset
Context
Life expectancy at birth is a key metric reflecting the average number of years a person can expect to live from birth, considering current mortality rates. Across the globe, life expectancy varies widely due to factors such as healthcare access, socio-economic conditions, and lifestyle choices. Developed nations often boast higher life expectancies, typically ranging from 75 to 85 years, owing to advanced healthcare systems and improved living standards. In contrast, developing nations often face shorter life expectancies, frequently falling below 70 years, largely due to inadequate healthcare infrastructure and prevailing socio-economic challenges. These disparities underscore the critical importance of global efforts to enhance healthcare access and address socio-economic inequalities.
